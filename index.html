    <h3>Moretion is a motion tracking smartwatch app, that alerts you when the hand your smartwatch device is on is in direct contact with your face.</h3>
    <h3>Moretion has been created to help its users limit the amount of time there is hand to face contact when the smartwatch app is in use.

Moretion features are designed to help limit the possibility of contracting the coronavirus through alerting the user when there is hand to face contact.</h3>
    <h3>When the app is installed on both the iPhone device and smartwatch app, the smartwatch companion app can be utilised by hard pressing on the screen once the smartwatch app is opened.</h3>
